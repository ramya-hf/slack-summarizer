# 🎨 Enhanced Canvas Workflow Guide

## 🎯 **Perfect Workflow - Exactly What You Wanted!**

I've enhanced the system to work **exactly** like you described. Here's your ideal workflow:

### **Step 1: Create Your Named Canvas**
```bash
/canvas create "Test Canvas"
```
✅ Creates a beautiful Canvas titled "Test Canvas" with channel tab integration

### **Step 2: Populate Canvas with Channel Messages**
```bash
/task "Test Canvas"
```
✅ Processes ALL channel messages → Creates todos → Updates your specific "Test Canvas"

**Result:** Your Canvas will look exactly like the image you showed, with interactive checkboxes!

## 🚀 **Enhanced `/task` Command Features**

### **Option 1: Update Specific Canvas**
```bash
/task "Canvas Name"
```
- ✅ Finds your existing canvas by name
- ✅ Processes all channel messages (last 500)
- ✅ Creates todos from actionable content
- ✅ Updates your specific canvas with beautiful formatting
- ✅ Shows success message with canvas link

### **Option 2: Use Default Canvas**
```bash
/task
```
- ✅ Creates/uses default "Todo List" canvas
- ✅ Same processing and formatting
- ✅ For users who want simple workflow

## 📋 **What Your Canvas Will Look Like**

After running `/task "Test Canvas"`, your Canvas will have:

```markdown
# 📋 Todo List - #social

## ✅ **Interactive Checkbox Features**

Your Canvas will have **real checkboxes** that team members can:
- ✅ **Click to check off** completed tasks
- ✅ **See visual progress** with checked/unchecked states  
- ✅ **Collaborate in real-time** on task completion
- ✅ **Track completion automatically**

## 🎯 **Exact Usage Examples**

### **Scenario 1: Project Management**
```bash
# Create project canvas
/canvas create "Sprint 1 Tasks"

# Populate with team messages
/task "Sprint 1 Tasks"

# Result: Beautiful project board with all team discussions converted to actionable todos
```

### **Scenario 2: Multiple Canvas Boards**
```bash
# Create different boards for different purposes
/canvas create "Bug Fixes"
/canvas create "Feature Requests" 
/canvas create "Meeting Action Items"

# Update specific boards
/task "Bug Fixes"
/task "Feature Requests"
/task "Meeting Action Items"

# Each canvas gets relevant todos!
```

### **Scenario 3: Daily Workflow**
```bash
# Morning: Create today's board
/canvas create "Daily Tasks - Jan 15"

# Process overnight messages
/task "Daily Tasks - Jan 15"

# Afternoon: Add manual todo
/todo add "Follow up with client"

# Canvas auto-updates with new todo!
```

## 🔄 **Smart Canvas Management**

### **Canvas Detection Logic:**
1. **Specific Canvas:** `/task "Canvas Name"` looks for exact title match
2. **Canvas Not Found:** Helpful error message suggests creating it first
3. **Default Canvas:** `/task` creates/uses "Todo List" canvas
4. **Auto-Sync:** Every todo change automatically updates canvas

### **Error Handling:**
```bash
/task "Nonexistent Canvas"
# Result: ❌ Canvas 'Nonexistent Canvas' not found. Use `/canvas create "Nonexistent Canvas"` first.
```
